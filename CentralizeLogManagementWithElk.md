## Centralized Log Management Solution with ELK docker container.

ELK compose of Elastic Search , Logstash and Kibana as a unified solution to collect the logs from distributed sources and centrize the log managment. By runnign ELK in docker allows to run multiple instances ELK connecting to remote targets over Syslog channel to collect the logs and share them to Kibana dashboard. This approach can be very useful in setups where multiple embedded targets are connected to an automated test server which performs tests on the remote boards and the log outputs from the tests can be consolidated and analyzed. The powerful search funtionality of hte Elastic allows mining of test and can search and patterns of keywords in the log [like "reset" ,system out of memory etc...] 

The following section covers the sequence involved in starting the  elk contianer with the configuration of  logstash listening to the port 5000/tcp . Subsequenlty the setup will configure to forward these logs to port 9200 of the elastic search to perform log indexing


------------------------------

### Step 1 : Understand some basic commands to work with the docker container

1. Enable docker to to print the logs from the elk docker container
	* sudo docker logs elk

2. Run docker container /sebp/elk
 	*  sudo docker run -p 5601:5601 -p 9200:9200 -p 5044:5044 -p 5000:5000 -v /data/logstash:/etc/logstash/conf.d -it --name elk     	  sebp/elk
         * nc localhost 5000 < /var/log/dpkg.log

2. With elk running ,attach to the container shell by executing 
	* sudo docker exec -it elk /bin/bash

3.  stops the elk
	* sudo docker stop elk
	
4.  to remove the container 
	* sudo docker rm elk

### Step 2 : Configuring Syslog
Now need to create a syslog configuration file for the logstash.
Create a directory /data/logstash in host and create a syslog.conf file

	 cd /data/logstash
	 ls
         sudo rename syslog.conf 99-syslog.conf


The /data/logstash is mounted at the /etc/logstash/conf.d directory of container running logstash.
Now with the this mounted directory /data/logstash has only the syslgo.conf file and and it loads with that.
 
### Step 3 : Configuring Logstash

Include the following configuration to allow  logstash to listen to the logs coming on 5000/tcp 
port of the elk container and forward them to the 9200 port of the container to get the logs indexed by elastic search

== Created a/data/logstash/tcp.conf with the following configuraiton
==== However an attempt to define the p 5000/udp and associate it with syslog doesnt work well. **Now lets try with the tcp config**

**tcp.conf**
------------
	osboxes@osboxes:/data/logstash$ cat tcp.conf 
	input {
		tcp {	port => 5000	}
	}	
	

	-- Add your filters / logstash plugins configuration here
	
	output {
		elasticsearch { hosts => ["localhost:9200"] }
		stdout { codec => rubydebug }

	
	}
Now what this declares is a tcp input port @5000 and output to localhost:9200 the elasticsearch

Now we can search whether someone is listening on the port 5000

osboxes@osboxes:/data/logstash$ netstat -an | grep 5000
tcp6       0      0 :::5000                 :::*                    LISTEN  

With now elk running ,try to do a bulk data write to 5000 using nc


  	126  nc localhost 5000 < /var/log/dpkg.log
  	127  nc localhost 5000 < /var/log/Xorg.0.log
  	128  cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log

This now shows the data is written to logstash

============================================================

The following exercise was done to configure the rsyslog in the ubuntu host to accept 
logs over tcp/udp @ default 514. To make this functional enable the streaming input by
configuring the /etc/syslog.conf

-----
	osboxes@osboxes:/etc/rsyslog.d$ cat /etc/rsyslog.conf
	#  /etc/rsyslog.conf	Configuration file for rsyslog.
	#
	#			For more information see
	#			/usr/share/doc/rsyslog-doc/html/rsyslog_conf.html
	#
	#  Default logging rules can be found in /etc/rsyslog.d/50-default.conf
